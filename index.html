        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is 
            available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and 
            Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, 
            Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). Visual Studio Code is an editor first and foremost, and includes 
            the features you need for highly productive source code editing. Visual Studio Code has support for 
            almost every major programming language. Several ship in the box, for example, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, 
            and HTML but more rich language extensions can be found in the VS Code Marketplace.

            Console
        </h2>
        <p>
            Alternatively referred to as a computer console, root console, system console, or terminal. Console is a basic 
            computer or monitor and keyboard that is connected to another computer, server, or a mainframe over a network. 
            It is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer. Type your code into the console, then 
            put console.log(x) and run the code. You can click the "Run" button or press Ctrl+Enter. Did you know that you 
            can include multiple values? Add a string to the beginning to easily identify what it is you are logging. Ex: 
            console.log("x:", x). But what if we have multiple values that we want to log? Instead of typing console.log() 
            three times we can include them all. And we can add a string before each of them if we wanted, too. Ex: 
            console.log("x:", x, "y:", y, "z:", z). But that's too much work. Just wrap them with curly braces! Now you get 
            an object with the named values. Ex: console.log( {x, y, z} ). You can do the same thing with an object.                  `
